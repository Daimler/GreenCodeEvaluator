Repository for the HerHackathon 2021


- Every participant should have her own GitHub account
- For each team, a participant forks this repo and gives her teammates access rights accordingly
- Each team works on their own repository. It is probably beneficial to be familiar with GitHub Actions to have a common development environment
- At the end, teams can submit pull requests back to this repo, where appropriate. Please note that we ask you to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/Daimler/daimler-foss/blob/master/cla/2019-09-11_Daimler_FOSS_CLA_DaimlerTSS.pdf) and then submit to [Daimler TSS CLA team](mailto:CLA-TSS@daimler.com) so that we can accept your contribution.
